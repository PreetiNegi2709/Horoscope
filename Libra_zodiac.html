You may have Libran pals whose company you love, but whose values and opinions you couldn’t, if pressured, articulate. Nor could they (though they’ll know yours).</p>

Librans are no exception, but what they tend to do with this information represents a conflict in their character: the urge and need to gossip. On the one hand, they kinda know it’s going to backfire and they hate to be disliked and they abhor conflict and confrontations. BUT, on the other hand, that’s all in a hypothetical distant future. Right here, right now, the easiest way to impress/humour/cajole the person in front of them is to drop a juicy goss-bomb. So that is what they do. Can’t help it nu-uh.</p>

They deconstruct every situation with their little legal eagle brain and pick over the debris, organising right from wrong. However, they're often biased in their own favour. So, when they’re carefully, painstakingly explaining why they should take the bigger room, in their own mind, it DOES make sense. To everyone else? Nope.</p>

They always want the best experience and they believe, through logic and rationale and analysis, they can actually create ‘perfect pathways’ through life, sidestepping dodgy meals, hop-skipping queues.. This nitpicking over-thinking of every thing is apt to drive partners and friends/family of Librans up the wall.</p>
