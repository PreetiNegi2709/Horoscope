                              <p class = "min_box_cap_head_p">Cancerians have an almost supernatural sense of intuition - they know what you’re thinking, and they know what you did. Don’t try and lie to them, hoodwink them, or manipulate them because you’re tangling with a dangerous creature. This instinctive ability to sniff out secrets can also make them a tad oversensitive (paranoid?) as they constantly try to work out who's lying.</p>

                              <p class = "min_box_cap_head_p">No star sign is more loyal than Cancer. They have a total blind spot for those they love, and will overlook almost anything… That said, they demand the same in return. If they’re into you, you’ll know about it, and if you enjoy romance-on-tap and having a constant companion, then congratulations. If, however, you need space and privacy, then commiserations. Cancer will invade every corner of your life, and install themselves there.</p>

You can walk in the room and they’re laughing and joking (they always have a great sense of humour), nip out to get something, return and find them lying on the floor in tears. This is just everyday Cancer life. Get used to it, and ride the waves.</p>

So, expect to discover a cupboard full of exes and old flames. They can’t (and won’t) turn their feelings off once they have been ignited. If you go way back with a Cancerian, chances are you’re in it for life. They’ll always remember your birthday, ask how your mum is, and sense instantly how things truly are. Chances are your Cancerian friend still lives where they grew up, in the bosom of their family, surrounded by old pals.</p>
