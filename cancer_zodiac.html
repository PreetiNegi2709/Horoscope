Don’t try and lie to them, hoodwink them, or manipulate them because you’re tangling with a dangerous creature. This instinctive ability to sniff out secrets can also make them a tad oversensitive (paranoid?) as they constantly try to work out who's lying.</p>

                              <p class = "min_box_cap_head_p">Feelings = ugh. Geminis are not known for being sentimental or emotional, they are the kind of friend who will disappear if you start crying (unless you’re also simultaneously revealing some really juicy gossip.) They leaning on the analytical, mental and cerebral side of life, making it easier for them to disconnect and see situations dispassionately. They adore dissecting thorny issues but they’re likely to come up with some pretty, quite frankly, psychopathic-sounding solutions.</p>

They are still into the latest trends long after everyone else has “settled down” (Geminis hate the idea of “settling down”, sounds dangerously like “dying” to them.)
                                The flip side of looking young and being so perky can mean they are also flaky, childish and silly at times. They also party WAY too much.</p>

They have no problem spreading news around - surely that’s what everyone is doing anyway, right? Their moral compass can waiver when they’re tempted to tell everyone everything.</p>

                            Geminis are the uber-flirts of the zodiac, and can chat up anyone, anywhere, anytime. They never run out of news, info, gossip and charm, and they are ruled by Mercury - the planet of communication. Geminis always seem youthful, energetic, and full of fun and good humour.
