You will, at first, think your Gemmy friend is across everything. In truth, they often skim-read and acquire titbits of knowledge, like the Mercurial magpie they are, BUT it only ever reaches skin-deep. Their interest rarely lingers long enough for them to truly delve into any one subject. A bit of knowledge… And they’re off to the next shiny gem.</p>

Geminis are not known for being sentimental or emotional, they are the kind of friend who will disappear if you start crying (unless you’re also simultaneously revealing some really juicy gossip.) They leaning on the analytical, mental and cerebral side of life, making it easier for them to disconnect and see situations dispassionately. They adore dissecting thorny issues but they’re likely to come up with some pretty, quite frankly, psychopathic-sounding solutions.</p>

They are still into the latest trends long after everyone else has “settled down” (Geminis hate the idea of “settling down”, sounds dangerously like “dying” to them.)
                                The flip side of looking young and being so perky can mean they are also flaky, childish and silly at times. They also party WAY too much.</p>

They have no problem spreading news around - surely that’s what everyone is doing anyway, right? Their moral compass can waiver when they’re tempted to tell everyone everything.</p>
