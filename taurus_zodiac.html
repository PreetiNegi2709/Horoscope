There is no task or challenge that will beat them, they have endless reserves of tenacity, patience and resilience. Like the tide on the shore, they’ll just keep coming back at it. Until it becomes something which, seriously, it’s time to move on from i.e. relationships, feuds, hotdog-eating competitions etc.</p>

What actually drives this is a deeply-held desire to ponder and consider their every move (as well as yours.) They like to analyse… everything. And it’s this eternal deliberation which makes them so darned stubborn. They have already thought it all through (trust me) and therefore are totally clear on and committed to where they stand.</p>

So: food, drink, chilling, pampering, shopping, sex. Basically, that’s it. That activity-combo is what makes Taurus tick. And, they can have difficulty finding the off button for the aforementioned. This can lead them into trouble...</p>

                            Taureans are naturally sexy people, because they are ruled by Venus, the planet of love and pleasure no less. Taureans have a strong inner self-belief, which doesn’t need shouting about, and this draws people to them because they can be trusted. Taureans don’t sweat the small stuff, and this means they’re calming to be around. Taurus also knows how to have a good time, so they are fun and always-up-for-it company.<br><br> </p>
