They just "get" how you feel, never judge, listen endlessly. They are a deep well of human emotion and act like they've seen it all before. Nothing shocks them. That said, they often end up crying more than you. Always tears with Pisceans. Always. The world is a cruel place for them.</p>

For Pisces, out of sight is out of mind. They love to be in love, and don't like anything which shatters that rosy illusion and feeling.

They go with the flow, they can morph into the crowd. Their bottomless well of intuition, quick silver imagination and watery nature make them almost like shape shifters. Being the final sign of the zodiac also lends them the traits of the other eleven!</p>
