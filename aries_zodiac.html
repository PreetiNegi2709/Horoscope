Ask them anything and they’ll tell you what they think, like, ANYTHING. But there’s no malice, snideness or bad intentions in their outspokenness. They just wear their heart on their sleeve.</p>

Underneath this hard-wired competitive streak lies a really vulnerable achilles heel: insecurity. Deep DEEP down, all Aries wonder if they’re really, truly good enough. </p>

But, remember that secret insecurity? It’s there, always, nagging at them, and this can make for a lot of internalised stress and pressure - all self-inflicted. Aries needs to learn to chill out and be nicer to themselves sometimes.</p>
