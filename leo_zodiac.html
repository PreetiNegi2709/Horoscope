                              <p class = "min_box_cap_head_p">Leos come in-built with a flair for drama and flamboyance. Every social interaction is viewed as a scene in which they are the entertainer, commanding the audience, receiving a standing ovation for every joke, anecdote and tall tale (they love a tall tale.) This means they’re never dull, they can definitely ‘work’ the crowd… but give someone else the stage? Never.</p>

There is no second fiddle for Leo, or any justifiable obstacle as to why they shouldn’t have exactly what they want, when they want it. This is great if you’re riding in their wake, benefiting from their ‘demands’, but not so much fun if you’re the one trying to enforce some rules / order / boundaries (good luck with that).</p>

And their regal aura usually does the trick, ushering others to just fall in line. However, this can come over as arrogance sometimes, or a mind-blowingly annoying ‘I know best’ attitude. They LOVE giving (unsolicited) advice.</p>

You may need 'time outs' to recharge your applause vigour!</p>
