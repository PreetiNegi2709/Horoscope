They evolve into diligent perfectionists who can’t bear to see anything delivered in a shoddy way and will happily take on extra to avoid that happening. There’s a fine line here, though, between working hard in the team and becoming a monstrous control freak who tries to do everyone else’s job for them. Yup, tricky.</p>

                              <p class = "min_box_cap_head_p">Virgos seriously LOVE helping other people out, proving their worth, being leaned on, feeling valued. However, they do (quietly, mind you) expect gratitude, recognition and maybe a lil’ reward. They won’t ever state this overtly (too crass), they’ll just ramp up the favours/tasks completed in the hope you WILL HAVE TO acknowledge it. This can become a vicious circle because, eventually, others take this level of servitude for granted and this then really annoys Virgos. Internally, the inner judge is unleashed, harping on about other people’s lack of manners/gratitude/morals etc… Just say ‘thank you’ when your Virgo pal does you a solid. PLEASE.</p>

                            Virgos are all perfectionists, so they always look, act and behave perfectly, making them easy company. Underneath that glacial exterior, however, beats a very passionate heart so they can be full of surprises as you get to know them. They enjoy pleasing and helping others, so they’re generally good people to have in your life. Virgos are attractive because:<br><br> </p>
