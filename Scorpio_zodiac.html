If you’re going to come at them or theirs… you’d better not miss. They never forget or forgive, they just DON’T, they’re ice cold that way. And they will wait a long-ass time to get you back, but get you back they will.</p>

Anything unsolved, mysterious or hidden also draws them like moths to a flame. Some end up embroiled in dark and dangerous lifestyles, some flirt with the occult, some turn this courage into something heroic - doing roles ands jobs the rest of us would run away from.</p>

They love sex, they’re very physical, they don’t do ‘casual’, they’re super-intense. Sometimes this fierce love can tip over into something more controlling, but it comes from a place of wanting to protect you, of thinking they know better, of believing you’re too precious a kitten to be let loose in the world. Sometimes it’s magical… sometimes it can get a bit much.</p>

Give a Scorpio a meaningful and positive purpose and they could change the world - there’s no stopping them. Self-doubt, recriminations, a lack of confidence… this is alien to them. They know what they want and they believe they’re entitled to get it. Faced with problems, their razor-sharp intellect can create flexible and out-there solutions and get-arounds. Their charm can win over enemies (though they’ll have noted them down in their ‘Grudge Book’ for later… revenge is best served cold).</p>
